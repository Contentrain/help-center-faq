We hope Q-Stack will help anyone who needs to keep a Faq page for their projects.\n\nYou can customize this template as you wish by copying it to your own repository and pulling it to your local.\n\n[Live Preview](https://delicate-empanada-f78c32.netlify.app/)\n\n## Headless CMS\n[![Use with Contentrain](https://imagedelivery.net/yx26LyQGM_miwnGU8RnEaw/721c176e-f4b1-4495-1d6c-87a4b9ffa100/public)](https://app.contentrain.io)\n\n\nTo manage the content of this template, we recommend you use [**Contentrain**](Contentrain).\n\nWe have created the **_questions** collection template that you need. You can find and use this collection in “Community Collections”.\n\nAfter free registration with [Contentrain](**Contentrain**), you need to start a manual project installation and continue the installation by selecting the Q-Stack repo on Github.\n\nDuring the installation, it is enough to delete the sample collections in the Collections step, select the **_questions** collection from the Community Collections section and complete the installation.\n\nThis way you can easily manage all your FAQ Questions with Contentrain.\n\nIf you have any questions about the installation, you can send us your questions via [Discord](**Discord**).\n\nWe will soon publish a video about how to use this template with Contentrain.\n\n\n## Frontmatter\n#### Default\n|variable|description|options|\n|-|-|-|\n|title|Allows you to set the title for your questions.|-|\n|category|Allows you to set categories for your questions.| -|\n\n\nThis is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).\n\n\n## Setup\n\nFirst, run the development server:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or\nyarn dev\n```\n\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.\n\nYou can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.\n\n[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.\n\nThe `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.\n\n## Deploy on Vercel\n\nThe easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.\n\nCheck out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.\n",
