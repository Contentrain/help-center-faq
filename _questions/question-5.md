# Q-Stack [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/86ca144b-95be-4813-ae57-5d1ef8f23856/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/delicate-empanada-f78c32/deploys)


A free FAQ template created with [**Next JS**](https://nextjs.org) that you can use for your projects.

We are very pleased to share our free template. We hope Q-Stack will help anyone who needs to keep a Faq page for their projects.

You can customize this template as you wish by copying it to your own repository and pulling it to your local.

## Headless CMS
[![Use with Contentrain](https://imagedelivery.net/yx26LyQGM_miwnGU8RnEaw/721c176e-f4b1-4495-1d6c-87a4b9ffa100/public)](https://app.contentrain.io)


To manage the content of this template, we recommend you use [**Contentrain**](Contentrain).

We have created the **_questions** collection template that you need. You can find and use this collection in “Community Collections”.

After free registration with [Contentrain](**Contentrain**), you need to start a manual project installation and continue the installation by selecting the Q-Stack repo on Github.

During the installation, it is enough to delete the sample collections in the Collections step, select the **_questions** collection from the Community Collections section and complete the installation.

This way you can easily manage all your FAQ Questions with Contentrain.

If you have any questions about the installation, you can send us your questions via [Discord](**Discord**).

We will soon publish a video about how to use this template with Contentrain.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Setup

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
